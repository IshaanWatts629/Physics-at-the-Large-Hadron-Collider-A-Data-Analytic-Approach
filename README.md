# Physics-at-the-Large-Hadron-Collider-A-Data-Analytic-Approach

The emergence of modern Machine Learning techniques such as Neural Networks Auto-encoders can be widely used in Particle Physics. 
This has commonly been known as Multivariate Analysis in High Energy Physics as well. 
One application of these methods is in the Large Hadron Collider, to classify certain events as anomalies using parameters such as the transverse momentum, pseudo-rapidity and invariant mass.

## Tasks Completed

* **Signal Discovery Significance (Z):** A high value of Z indicates that for a sufficiently large background we can differentiate between signal and background curves.
* **Neural Network:** We are able to distinguish between distributions with high accuracy in a Supervised Learning task using Artificial Neural Networks.
* **Auto-Encoder:** Using unsupervised learning methods, it is feasible to identify anomalies in the data, allowing us to identify if a z-boson was formed in the process by learning the distributions.

Detailed analysis of these tasks is provided in the report.
